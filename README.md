Entrepreneurship and Innovation Final Project

Simulation of a Start-Up App as contribution to solve the first Sustainable Development Goal (No poverty) using Software Tools such as Excel, Thunkable and Google Forms.

An investigation was carried out on the problem of poverty within the Latin American region, after this analysis three ideas were created 
We analyzed each with the RCVE Priorization Matrix, finally we chose to support growing Start-ups within Latin America, focusing on the country Colombia.
For this we create an app (Thunkable) that could connect these Start Ups and small business with people who are unemployed, in addition this app will have support or 
investments from anyone who wants to contribute to the development of the country.

Afterwards, a survey was carried out on different people about this problem, and whether they considered that the app proposal could contribute to it.
After obtaining the data, and reformulating the situation and modifying the app based on the opinions received, we also checked the RCVE Priorization Matrix again.
Finally,with Excel, we carried out a financial analysis to ensure that the project was sustainable.






App - Unfortunatly because by the time I created this app my account was linked to the univeristy email and Im not a student of the ITESM anymore, the app is 
not more available for interacting)
